# 1. Mission Overview

The OSY Mars Production Pipeline defines the **complete fabrication, assembly, test, and deployment architecture** for the Mars Division.  
OSY (Orbital Shipyard) serves as the **primary industrial manufacturing center** for:

- MB-Class Mars Barges  
- MTS-1 / MTS-2 / MTS-3 Shuttle Fleets  
- MCM Container System (S/M/L)  
- MRCD Robotic Construction Fleet  
- Mars Orbital Depot Modules  
- Structural components for Mars base expansion  

This plan mirrors the OSY Lunar Pipeline but scales output for **deep-space cycle logistics** aligned with the ~26-month Mars window.
