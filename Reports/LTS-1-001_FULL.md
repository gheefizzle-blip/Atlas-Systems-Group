# 1. Mission Overview

LTS‑1 is the smallest and most agile member of the Lunar Tug Shuttle fleet.  
It is engineered for **high‑tempo, low‑mass operations**, transporting 1–2 ton standardized Lunar Cargo Modules (LCMs) between a cislunar depot and the lunar surface.

### Core Design Intent:
- Fully autonomous operations  
- Rapid payload turnover  
- Robust landing capability  
- Low propellant footprint  
- Zero-maintenance between sorties  
- Optimized for small construction modules, robotics, scientific payloads  

LTS‑1 is the “pickup truck” of the lunar logistics ecosystem.

# 2. Vehicle Architecture

## 2.1 Structural Frame
- Titanium/aluminum truss architecture  
- Landing legs integrated into load path  
- Multi-point crush structures for uneven terrain  
- Dust‑tolerant hinges and thermal‑insulated joints  

## 2.2 Dimensions (Target)
- Height: **7–9 m**  
- Span (landing legs): **5.5–6.5 m**

# 3. Propulsion System

## 3.1 Engine Architecture
LTS‑1 uses a dual-mode propulsion system:

### **A. NH3/LOX Chemical Mode (Primary)**
- High thrust for lunar descent/ascent  
- Regolith-safe nozzle and deflector design  

### **B. Cracked NH3 Hydrogen-Enhanced Mode**
- Optional hydrogen-enriched combustion  
- Improves thrust and efficiency for heavy ascent  

**No reactor onboard**  
LTS‑1 receives its propellant from depot tanks.

### Step 3 — Container Offload
- Drops container using bottom-mounted magnetic/rail clamps  
- Surface robotics retrieve container  

### Step 4 — Pickup of Empty Containers
- Optional recovery of empties or swap  

### Step 5 — Ascent
- High-thrust chemical mode  
- Rendezvous with depot  

### Step 6 — Refuel & Repeat
- Ready for another sortie within hours
