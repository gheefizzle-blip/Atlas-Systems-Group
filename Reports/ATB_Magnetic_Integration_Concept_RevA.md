Classification: Internal – Engineering Concept Evaluation

## 1. Executive Summary
Magnetic-based assembly systems have gained traction for orbital construction due to their simplicity, self-aligning properties, and low operational overhead. After review of the Ariel Ekblaw “Space Tiles” concept and related modular magnetic demonstrations, this report evaluates integration into OSY operations.

**Magnets are a high-value alignment and modular outfitting technology, but not a substitute for structural or pressurized mechanical joints.**

Correctly deployed, magnetic tiles and magnetic-assisted fixtures accelerate assembly, simplify robotic workflows, and increase operational flexibility across OSY’s construction, refueling, and repair missions.

## 2. OSY Operational Context
The OSY is an industrial-class orbital shipyard focused on:
- Heavy spacecraft construction
- Fueling, tank exchange, and component swap operations
- Large module repair and refurbishment
- Zero-G commercial workspace rentals
- Long-duration habitation in the habitat wheel

This mission profile demands structural reliability, predictable load paths, and high safety margins. Any new assembly technology must respect those requirements.

## 3. Magnetic System Use-Cases

### 3.1 High-Value Applications (Recommended)

#### A. Robotic Alignment & Pre-Capture
Magnets act as a stabilizing “third hand” to:
- Pull components into rough alignment
- Seat panels before mechanical engagement
- Aid autonomous and teleoperated robot docking
- Stabilize panels pre-weld or pre-bolt

This reduces drift, tool complexity, and EVA time.

#### B. Interior Modular Tile Systems
Applies to:
- Labs, research bays
- Workspaces and storage grids
- Equipment racks
- Removable insulation or radiation tiles

This supports rapid interior reconfiguration with zero structural risk.

#### C. Service Cells & Tooling Platforms
In non-pressurized bays:
- Toolboards
- Diagnostic racks
- Power/data passthrough panels
- Modular welding/repair jigs

Streamlines maintenance and turnover.

#### D. External Temporary Fixtures
For EVA and robot-assisted operations:
- Temporary scaffolding
- Shield panel seating
- Truss alignment during repair

Strictly for alignment and temporary stabilization.

## 4. Low-Value / High-Risk Applications (Not Recommended)

### 4.1 Primary Load Structures
Magnets are unsuitable for:
- Central spine
- Habitat wheel
- Docking collars
- Fuel tank arms
- Crane rails
- Major truss assemblies

Mechanical hard joints are required for structural load, thermal stability, and micrometeoroid resilience.

### 4.2 Pressurized Modules
Pressurized sections require:
- Shear/tension load transfer
- Hard seals
- Redundant locking systems
- Thermal and vibration stability

Magnets cannot replace mechanical seals or locks.

## 5. Engineering Constraints & Risks

### 5.1 Magnetic Strength Limits
- Heat degradation
- Radiation drift
- Shock/vibration load failures
- Long-term shear creep

### 5.2 EMI Interference
Strong magnets may affect:
- Sensors
- Drives
- Instruments

Shielding and field shaping will be required.

### 5.3 Vacuum Demagnetization
Vacuum and thermal cycling accelerate magnetic drift. Requires material characterization.

### 5.4 Structural Guarantees
Magnets cannot provide:
- Shear rigidity
- Tensile strength
- Predictable safety margins

Primary OSY structures must rely on mechanical locks.

## 6. Recommended OSY Magnetic System Architecture

### Tier 1 — Assistive Magnetic Interfaces (Structural)
- Alignment aids
- Pre-capture surfaces
- Temporary stabilization panels
- Integrated into truss nodes and panel edges

### Tier 2 — Modular Interior Magnetic Tiles (Non-Structural)
- Labs
- Workspaces
- Toolboards
- Sensor tiles
- Radiation/water tiles

### Tier 3 — Robotic Magnetic Tooling Interfaces
- End-effector magnetic capture
- Tool changeout surfaces
- Calibration tiles

## 7. Prototype Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Ground Testing
- Magnet strength characterization
- Vacuum thermal cycling
- EMI impact studies
- Shear creep evaluations
- Robotic pre-capture simulations

### Phase 2 — Bench-Scale Prototypes
- 30×30 cm magnetic test tiles
- 1×1 m modular interior tiles
- Magnetic robotic capture pads

### Phase 3 — On-Orbit Demonstration Module (OSY-01A)
- Mounted to OSY external bay
- Tests alignment, toolboard integration, and drift
- Collects long-term performance data

## 8. Final Assessment
Magnetic integration is viable under controlled, non-structural use cases.

**Approved:**
- Alignment systems
- Modular interiors
- Robotic workflows

**Rejected:**
- Primary structure
- Pressurized joints

This hybrid strategy upgrades OSY capability without compromising structural integrity.

## 9. ATB Decision Request
The ATB is requested to review and vote on:

1. Approval of magnetic alignment systems for OSY structural workflow
2. Approval of magnetic modular interior systems
3. Approval of magnetic interfaces for robotic tooling
4. Approval of the three-phase prototype roadmap
