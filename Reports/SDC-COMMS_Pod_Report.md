# SDC-COMMS TECHNICAL REPORT  
## MAG-LIFT POD SYSTEMS: DESIGN AND ALTITUDE DELIVERY

(This file contains the full report as requested.)

### 1. POD DESIGN
- Modular pods, 300–800 kg classes
- Composite shell, magnetic docking
- Cold-gas + ammonia trim
- Avionics: INU, GNSS, star tracker

### 2. LAUNCH TOWER PARAMETERS
- 500 m electromagnetic tower
- Exit velocity: 1500–1800 m/s
- Vertical or slight-tilt ejection
- Launch altitude: ~2.2 km ASL

### 3. ALTITUDE DELIVERY
- 1500 m/s: 70–82 km
- Optimized: 85–95 km
- 1800 m/s: 110–130 km (Kármán-class)

### 4. INTERCEPT MODEL
- Pods form clusters at apogee
- Tug intercept at 110–140 km
- Minimal ΔV cost for final insertion

### 5. SDC-COMMS NOTES
- LOS windows
- Cluster coordination
- Optical link acquisition
- Network timing model
