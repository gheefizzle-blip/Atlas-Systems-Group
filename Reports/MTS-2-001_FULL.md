# 1. Mission Overview

MTS-2 is the **workhorse** of the Mars Division fleet: a medium‑class shuttle engineered for high‑mass cargo delivery to the Martian surface and rapid orbital turnaround.  
It mirrors LTS‑2 but is adapted for atmospheric entry, dust storms, and the 0.38g environment.

### Core objectives:
- Deliver **5–8 ton** MCM‑M containers  
- Survive full EDL (Entry, Descent, Landing) cycles  
- Perform propulsive landing + ascent  
- Operate fully autonomously or under human oversight  
- Interface seamlessly with the Mars Barge and Mars Depot  
- Zero crew required for standard operations  

MTS‑2 is the backbone of Mars base construction phases.

# 4. Propulsion System

MTS‑2 uses a **dual‑mode propulsion suite:**

### A. CH4/LOX or NH3/LOX Chemical Engines  
- Primary descent/ascent thrust  
- Optimized for dusty regolith environments  
- Ignition redundancy (dual spark + TEA‑TEB equivalent)

### B. Hydrogen‑Enriched Hybrid Mode  
- Derived from onboard ammonia cracking  
- Higher Isp for ascent with heavy payloads  
- Automatically activated when mass‑to‑orbit margin requires it
