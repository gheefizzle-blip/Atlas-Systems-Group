# 1. Mission Overview

MTS-3 is the **flagship heavy shuttle** of the Mars Division fleet.  
It is engineered for:

- Delivery of **10–20 ton** MCM-L containers  
- Transport of **4–8 crew** for early human missions  
- Reusable EDL and ascent under Martian atmospheric constraints  
- Autonomous or human-supervised operation  
- Long-duration surface stays (up to 72 hours)  
- Full return capability to Mars orbital depots or the Mars Barge  

MTS-3 forms the backbone of heavy infrastructure deployment and the first wave of human-assisted Martian base expansion.
