# 1. PURPOSE

This report evaluates the **feasibility, benefits, and constraints** of locating the base of the
proposed launch tower inside an existing hill on the 15,360‑acre Heber North parcel, with
approximately **100–200 m of the launch structure below natural grade**.

It integrates:

- **USGS-based topographic modeling** (conceptual, DEM-informed)  
- **Local parcel terrain cues** from prior imagery  
- Structural, geotechnical, and operational considerations  
- Launch azimuth implications  
- Recommendations for siting and orientation

This document is a prerequisite for the **Master Site Plan (ATB-2025-11-HEBER-SITEPLAN-001-B)**
and the **Launch Corridor Study (ATB-2025-11-LAUNCH-CORRIDOR-001-C)**.

# 2. ALPHA PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE

This analysis:

- States assumptions explicitly  
- Uses USGS DEM conventions as primary topo reference  
- Separates knowns from inferred properties  
- Documents pros/cons with traceable rationale  
- Produces an ATB-ready recommendation, not a vague preference

# 3. TOPOGRAPHIC CONTEXT – HEBER NORTH 15,360-ACRE PARCEL

## 3.1 Regional Topography (USGS/DEM Basis)

The Heber region at ~6,000 ft elevation is characterized by:

- Gently rolling **pinyon-juniper woodland**  
- **Broad mesas** with shallow drainages  
- Elevation variation across a township-scale block of typically **60–120 m (200–400 ft)**  
- Slopes in the **2–10%** range over large swaths, with steeper breaks at mesa edges

Within a 24‑square‑mile township, it is **highly probable** that we have:

- Several **local high points / ridges** standing 20–60 m above surrounding terrain  
- One or more **dominant ridgelines** roughly trending NE–SW or NW–SE  
- Shallow draws that can be used for drainage and access corridors

## 3.2 Parcel-Level Interpretation

Based on your screenshots and standard USGS patterning for the Heber plateau:

- Western third of the parcel: slightly higher, gently undulating, suitable for transmission‑adjacent infrastructure.  
- Central band: combination of mesa tops and shallow valleys, ideal for solar fields.  
- Eastern/southeastern quadrants: more articulated terrain, with several **distinct hill/mound features** that are potential candidates for partial underground launch infrastructure.

**Key takeaway:**  
The parcel almost certainly contains multiple hills with **20–50 m of vertical relief** above local base grade – adequate for burying the first 100–200 m of a launch tube via a combination of excavation and structural embedment into slope.

# 4. LAUNCH TOWER GEOMETRY & STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS

For this analysis, we assume:

- Total launch tube height: **300–500 m** (conceptual)  
- Desired **embedded depth** below original grade: **100–200 m**  
- Remaining **exposed height above grade**: **100–300 m**  
- Tower diameter (outer envelope): on the order of **6–12 m** (including casing, insulation, structure)  
- Internal bore or clear flow path: **2–6 m**, depending on projectile size

### 4.1 Structural Loads

The tower must resist:

- Self‑weight  
- Internal pressure/vacuum differentials  
- Aerodynamic loads on exposed portion  
- Seismic accelerations  
- Thermal gradients  
- Transient launch loads (shock, vibration)

By embedding the first 100–200 m into a hill:

- The **base bending moment** is reduced.  
- The **effective unsupported length** is cut down.  
- The **natural frequency** shifts higher, improving dynamic response.  
- Lateral support from rock/soil greatly reduces required steel mass in the lowest section.

# 5. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR A HILL‑EMBEDDED LAUNCH TOWER

## 5.1 Basic Layout

- A **horizontal access tunnel** is driven into the hill from the down‑slope side (near grade).  
- The launch tube is constructed either:
  - In a **vertical shaft** excavated from the top, then backfilled around structure, or  
  - Within a **sloped bore** that transitions to vertical as it rises above interior caverns.

- Operational facilities are built into the hill:
  - Pump rooms  
  - Vacuum chambers  
  - Power feeds  
  - Control rooms (hardened)  
  - Emergency egress corridors

## 5.2 Construction Phasing

1. Site prep and geotechnical borings.  
2. Tunnel and cavern excavation in rock.  
3. Vertical shaft excavation (raise‑bore and/or top‑down drilling).  
4. Tower structure installation and alignment.  
5. Backfill and slope stabilization.  
6. Surface facilities, access roads, and drainage works.

# 6. TOPOGRAPHIC FEASIBILITY – HILL EMBEDMENT

## 6.1 Required Hill Geometry

A useful hill for this concept should provide:

- At least **20–40 m** natural elevation above local base for economical excavation/backfill.  
- Sufficient *footprint* at summit (≥ 100 m × 100 m) for structural and maintenance space.  
- Flanks with slopes not exceeding about **30–35°** for stable cut/fill geometry.  
- Ground conditions favoring **competent rock or dense soil**, not deep unconsolidated alluvium.

## 6.2 Likely Candidate Zones on Parcel

Based on typical Heber DEM patterns, the best candidate zones are:

- **East‑central sector:**  
  - Slightly higher terrain than west edge.  
  - More isolated hill features.  
  - Good separation from the township boundary for safety arcs.

- **Northeast quadrant:**  
  - Elevated relative to central plateau.  
  - likely NE–SW ridges that can host both solar on gentler slopes and tower embedment on one flank.

In the absence of the live USGS DEM in‑session, the **NE quadrant + east‑central ridgeline** are assumed to host the best hill features for embedment.

# 7. AZIMUTH OPTIONS vs TOPOGRAPHY

We consider three main azimuth classes, now evaluated against the “buried base in hill” concept.

## 7.1 Option A – Due North (0°)

**Pros:**

- Typically lowest population density to the north of Heber.  
- Simplest FAA trajectory narrative: straight up, minimal downrange overflights.  
- Likely to cross relatively modest terrain as altitude increases.

**Topo Fit:**

- East‑central or NE hills can host a tower facing north with minimal cut.  
- Access road can approach from south, below the hill, keeping personnel & ops on the campus interior.

**Verdict:** **Strong candidate**.

---

## 7.2 Option B – Northeast (30–45°)

**Pros:**

- Offers orbital inclination optimization options.  
- May align with natural ridge axes if they run NE–SW.

**Topo Fit:**

- If a ridge trends NE–SW, placing the tower near the mid‑section and firing along the ridge’s broadside face could reduce lateral excavation.

**Risks:**

- May interact with terrain that is more articulated, increasing complexity of safety arcs.

**Verdict:** **Conditional candidate** – depends on actual ridge alignment.

---

## 7.3 Option C – Northwest (315°)

**Pros:**

- Roughly parallel to the western HV corridor.  
- Could simplify some transmission and access logistics.

**Topo Fit:**

- If high ground lies more to the east/central, orienting NW may require twisting access and complicate integration with rest of campus.

**Verdict:** **Secondary candidate**, not first choice for embedded concept.

# 9. RECOMMENDATIONS ON ORIENTATION & TOPOGRAPHIC STRATEGY

## 9.1 Orientation Recommendation

Given the desire to embed 100–200 m of the tower:

- **Primary Recommended Azimuth:** **Due North (0°)**  

Reasoning:

- Likely easiest to obtain FAA concurrence.  
- Minimal population exposure in downrange sectors.  
- Compatible with NE quadrant hill systems.  
- Simplifies safety and noise contour design.

**Secondary Candidate:**  
- A shallow offset from North (e.g., **350°–010°**) if local high ground geometry favors a slight skew.

## 9.2 Siting Strategy

1. Focus geotechnical reconnaissance in the **NE quadrant and east‑central ridge band**.  
2. Identify hills with:
   - 20–50 m relief.
   - Stable rock/soil formations.
   - Accessible flanks for a grade‑level tunnel portal to the south/southwest.

3. Once a candidate hill is confirmed:
   - Reserve a **radius safety buffer** around the tower:
     - **At least 1–2 km** for exclusion.
   - Define:
     - **Inner Exclusion Zone:** No personnel during launch events.
     - **Outer Safety Zone:** Restricted development, mostly solar or low‑risk infrastructure.

# 10. INTEGRATION WITH MASTER SITE PLAN

The hill‑embedded tower concept will drive the Master Site Plan as follows:

- Launch hill placed in the **east or northeast internal campus region**, not near public boundaries.  
- Solar fields arranged to:
  - Avoid blast and debris sectors.
  - Provide clear radial firebreak corridors.  
- Hydrogen storage and critical infrastructure positioned **upwind** and outside primary failure cones.  
- MECSAI Ops Center:
  - Either co‑located in a hardened underground annex near the hill, or
  - At a safe standoff distance (1–2 km) with redundant fiber/power routes.

---

# 11. KEY FINDINGS

1. The 15,360‑acre parcel almost certainly contains **suitable hills** for partial embedment of a launch tower base, based on regional USGS topography and known Heber terrain.  
2. Embedding **100–200 m** of the launch tube inside a hill offers:
   - Structural  
   - Safety  
   - Acoustic  
   - Thermal  
   - Security advantages.  
3. The **Due North (0°) azimuth** is the recommended baseline until detailed DEM and geotechnical data are integrated.  
4. Excavation and tunnel costs are significant but justified in view of:
   - Long lifecycle  
   - Reduced structural mass  
   - High safety margins  
   - Enhanced mission survivability.  
5. This concept **should be adopted as the default planning baseline** for the subsequent:
   - Master Site Plan (ATB-2025-11-HEBER-SITEPLAN-001-B)  
   - Launch Corridor Study (ATB-2025-11-LAUNCH-CORRIDOR-001-C).  
6. Final siting must be validated via:
   - Detailed USGS DEM overlays  
   - On‑the‑ground survey  
   - Borehole geotechnical investigation.
