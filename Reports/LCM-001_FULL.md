# 1. Overview

The Lunar Cargo Module (LCM) System is the standardized, modular cargo backbone for all lunar logistics operations. Designed for compatibility with LTS-1, LTS-2, and LTS-3, LCMs enable fast, predictable, scalable transport of materials, equipment, habitats, robotics, and utilities between OSY, cislunar depots, and the lunar surface.

LCMs are engineered for:
- Robotic handling  
- Structural integrity under lunar gravity  
- Thermal protection  
- Regolith contamination resistance  
- High-volume automated production at OSY  

LCMs effectively turn the lunar logistics network into a **container ship model**, enabling a high-throughput supply chain with predictable interfaces and repeatable mission cycles.

# 2. LCM Family Overview

LCMs come in three primary classes:

## 2.1 LCM-S (Small)
- Mass capacity: **1–2 tons**
- Compatible with LTS-1 and LTS-2  
- Ideal for robotics, tools, sensors, and small structural elements  

## 2.2 LCM-M (Medium)
- Mass capacity: **5–8 tons**
- Primary load for LTS-2  
- Structural and utility modules, solar pallets, robotics packs  

## 2.3 LCM-L (Large)
- Mass capacity: **10–20 tons**
- Designed for LTS-3  
- Habitat sections, heavy machinery, water tanks, base modules  

All three share standardized attachment points, latching rails, and robotic interface geometry.

# 3. Structural Design

## 3.1 Frame
- Titanium-aluminum hybrid frame  
- Micrometeoroid-resistant composites  
- Crush-resistant corner posts  
- Shock-isolated internal mounting brackets  

## 3.2 Shell
- Carbon composite outer shell  
- Dust-sealed panel seams  
- Thermal emissivity coatings  
- Embedded reflective insulation  

## 3.3 Dimensions
### LCM-S
- 1.2m x 1.2m x 1.6m  
### LCM-M
- 2.4m x 2.4m x 3.6m  
### LCM-L
- 4.8m x 4.8m x 6.0m  

Final dimensions may adjust slightly as LTS cargo bays are finalized.

# 4. Robotic Interface System

LCMs are fully robotic-handling compatible.

## 4.1 Latching Rails

- Male/female universal docking connectors  
- Used to create “container stacks” on lunar surface  

## 4.3 RFID/Optical Tags
- Identification markers for:
  - LTS cargo alignment  
  - Depot automation  
  - Lunar robotics navigation

# 8. OSY Manufacturing Pipeline

LCMs are mass-produced at OSY using:

- Automated composite layup  
- Robotic welding  
- Zero-G frame assembly  
- Pre-installation of interior modules  
- QR-coded robotic handoff  

Production targets:
- **LCM-S:** 6 units/day  
- **LCM-M:** 2–3 units/day  
- **LCM-L:** 1 unit/day  

---

# 9. Logistics Flow

1. LCMs are loaded at OSY with mission-specific cargo  
2. Transferred to depot via orbital tug  
3. Loaded into LTS vehicles  
4. Delivered to lunar surface  
5. Robotics unload and sort by container type  
6. Empty LCMs returned to depot and OSY  

This creates a circular, high-throughput supply chain.
