# 1. Mission Overview

MTS-1 is the lightest and most agile shuttle in the Mars Division fleet.  
It is engineered for **rapid, autonomous ferry operations** between the Mars Barge (MB-Class), Mars orbital depots, and the Martian surface.

### Core objectives:
- Deliver **1–2 ton** cargo loads  
- Fully autonomous operations  
- Survive EDL (Entry, Descent, Landing) under Martian atmosphere  
- Perform propulsive landing + ascent  
- Return to orbital depots or barge for refuel and repeat  
- Zero human maintenance between sorties  

MTS-1 is the Martian equivalent of LTS-1, upgraded for atmospheric entry and dust-heavy conditions.
