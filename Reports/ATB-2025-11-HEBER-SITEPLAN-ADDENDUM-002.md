## 1. Purpose

This addendum updates the Heber North Campus Master Site Plan to include the
southern half of Township 13N Range 16E (parcels 201-02-005 and 201-02-006),
adding approximately 7,500 acres of federal land to the planning envelope and
extending the campus footprint to nearly 36 square miles.

## 2. Effects on Zoning and Safety

- The 3 km and 5 km safety arcs for the north-central launch tower remain fully
  internal to the combined campus.
- The southwestern parcel (201-02-006) improves separation from Camp Ponderosa
  and provides additional room for future hydrogen storage, construction staging,
  or a second launch corridor if needed.
- Southern parcels are primarily designated as:
  - Safety and exclusion buffer
  - Emergency egress and access road corridors
  - Long-term expansion zones

## 3. Updated Conceptual Layout

The combined campus now consists of:

- Northern Block (201-02-004): primary solar fields, hydrogen production,
  launch hill, MECSAI Ops Center, and substation.
- Southern Block (201-02-005 & 006): safety buffer, firebreaks, emergency
  access, and future expansion pads.

## 4. Recommendations

- Treat the full township as the planning unit for all NEPA, FAA, and BLM
  coordination.
- Obtain official BLM/USFS shapefiles for the southern parcels to refine
  internal zoning.
