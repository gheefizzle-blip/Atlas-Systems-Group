# 1. Executive Overview
This document outlines the internal concept architecture for the first Spear Enterprise Martian base. Designed for an equatorial, relatively flat site adjacent to a large hillside, it uses a hybrid surface–subsurface approach for long-term safety, thermal stability, and radiation protection. This is an internal Spear/ATB planning document and will be updated once customer, military, and scientific requirements are formalized.

---

# 2. Base Objectives
- Establish a hardened, semi-subterranean Martian settlement built entirely by MRCD robotics.
- Utilize a nearby hillside for excavation of deep shelters, thermal buffer chambers, and crew-safe vaults.
- Enable short-duration crew visits once the robotic base is complete.
- Integrate seamlessly with MTS-1/2/3 shuttles and MCM supply chain.
- Support long-term industrial and scientific expansion with scalable architecture.

---

# 3. Site Selection Criteria
- **Equatorial Region:** Maximizes solar availability and reduces night-side temperature drops.
- **Flat Terrain:** Ideal for MRCD grading, landing pads, and container staging.
- **Large Hillside/Escarpment:** Enables:
  - Excavation of subsurface habitats  
  - High radiation protection  
  - Thermal buffering  
  - Carved rover garage  
  - Emergency bunker construction
- **Stable Regolith:** Minimizes terrain settling risks.
- **Low Wind Channeling:** Reduces storm-induced abrasion.

# 4. Base Layout Overview

## 4.1 Landing Zone Cluster
- Three primary landing pads in triangular formation.
- MRCD-compacted regolith foundation.
- Plume-deflecting berms on all sides.
- Dedicated EDL corridor to minimize regolith contamination of habitats.

## 4.2 Subsurface Habitat Network (Hillside Carved)
Habitat modules are placed **inside the hillside** using MRCD excavation.

- Excavation depth: **5–12 meters**, depending on rock density.
- MCM-L habitat modules installed in a crescent or circular vault.
- Overburden: **5–12 meters** of rock/regolith for radiation shielding.
- Pressurized tunnels link all modules.
- Emergency escape shaft drilled deeper into hillside interior.

## 4.3 Surface Enclosures
- Hardened airlock domes for surface access.
- Dust mitigation vestibules with active blow-off fans.
- Shielded entrances for MRCD and MTS servicing.

## 4.4 Power Field & Storm Strategy
- 1–2 acre solar field.
- MRCD-built dust berms.
- Automated tilt/burial capability during dust storms.
- Power trenching to subsurface thermal buffer cavern carved into hillside.

## 4.5 MRCD Operations Zone
- Large staging yard for all MRCD classes.
- Semi-buried operations trench to reduce dust infiltration.
- Charging bays for solar/fuel-cell hybrid power units.

## 4.6 MCM Storage & Staging
- Tiered container yard near landing pads.
- Robotic rail-guided transport lanes.
- Access ramp into hillside excavation.

## 4.7 Pressurized Rover Garage (Hillside Carved)
- Carved directly into hillside rock.
- Multi-airlock configuration.
- Houses pressurized rovers, tool racks, and spare power packs.
- Functions as backup storm shelter.

## 4.8 Communications & Science Mast Cluster
- High-gain antenna.
- Optical beacon for MTS guidance.
- Radiation, seismic, and atmospheric sensors.

## 4.9 Utility Trunk Network
- Buried electrical/fiber conduits.
- Thermal loops connected to subterranean buffer chamber.
- Future ISRU-compatible hookups reserved.
