# 1. Executive Overview
This trade study evaluates all viable nuclear propulsion options for Spear Enterprise’s interplanetary tug fleet over the next 5–10 years, with a future-looking annex for advanced reactor concepts likely to mature within the next 10–20 years.

Primary focus is placed on propulsion systems that are:
- Deployable within current or near-term OSY capabilities  
- Compatible with the ammonia-to-hydrogen cracking architecture  
- Scalable to support barge towing, lunar/martian tug operations, and deep-space cargo lanes  
- Durable under high utilization cycles with predictable maintenance profiles

# 2. Propulsion Systems Evaluated (Core Study)

1. **Solid-Core Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)**
2. **Pebble-Bed NTP**
3. **LANTR (LOX-Augmented Nuclear Thermal Rocket)**
4. **Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)**
5. **Bimodal NTR (Thermal + Electric Modes)**

These five systems form the core of the engineering and operational analysis.

# 4. System-by-System Analysis

## 4.1 Solid-Core NTP
**Strengths**
- Mature design  
- High thrust for tug operations  
- Works perfectly with cracked-ammonia hydrogen  
- Excellent for lunar operations and orbital tugs  

**Weaknesses**
- Limited Isp ceiling  
- Reactor thermal stress over repeated cycles  

**Use Case**
- Primary propulsion for OSY tugs within 5-year window.

## 4.2 Pebble-Bed NTP
**Strengths**
- Higher core temperatures  
- Better heat transfer efficiency  
- Greater Isp than solid-core  
- Faster thermal cycling  

**Weaknesses**
- Complex fuel fabrication  
- Higher maintenance demands  

**Use Case**
- Next-gen tug upgrade path.  
- Best candidate for a 10-year deployment horizon.

## 4.3 LANTR (LOX-Augmented NTP)
**Strengths**
- 2–3× thrust boost over pure NTP  
- Perfect for heavy liftoff maneuvers  
- Synergizes with ammonia → H₂ cracking  

**Weaknesses**
- Requires LOX storage  
- More complex nozzle mixing zone  

**Use Case**
- Tugs requiring rapid orbital departure, heavy barge acceleration.

## 4.4 Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)
**Strengths**
- Extreme efficiency  
- Perfect for long-haul barge towing  
- Minimal propellant mass required  

**Weaknesses**
- Low thrust — cannot be used alone for high-mass LEO/Mars ascent  
- Requires high-power reactors  

**Use Case**
- Primary propulsion for **interplanetary barge towing**.  
- Paired with NTP/NTR for burns requiring thrust.

---

## 4.5 Bimodal NTR
**Strengths**
- One reactor, two modes  
- Thermal mode for maneuvers  
- Electric mode for cruise  
- High efficiency across mission phases  

**Weaknesses**
- Most complex system to maintain  
- Requires multi-mode reactor control  

**Use Case**
- Ultimate tug architecture.  
- Ideal for barge towing + high thrust as needed.
