# 1. Mission Overview

LTS-2 is the backbone of lunar industrialization, engineered to transport **5–8 ton standardized Lunar Cargo Modules (LCMs)** between a cislunar depot and the lunar surface. It operates as the primary workhorse for infrastructure deployment, base construction, and routine surface supply runs.

### Core Design Intent:
- Medium-heavy cargo delivery  
- High-cycle operational tempo  
- Rapid loading/unloading of LCMs  
- Optimized for modular construction payloads  
- Designed for both uncrewed and supervised missions  
- Maximum reliability with minimal maintenance  

LTS-2 is built for industrial-scale logistics.

# 2. Vehicle Architecture

## 2.1 Structural Frame
- Reinforced titanium spine with modular load ring  
- Carbon composite outer panels  
- Integrated structural supports for heavy LCMs  
- Dust-shielded joints and regolith-resistant geometric design  
- Thermal-isolated avionics bay  

## 2.2 Dimensions (Target)
- Height: **11–13 m**  
- Span (landing legs): **7–8 m**  
- Dry mass: **4,500–6,000 kg**

# 3. Propulsion System

## 3.1 Hybrid Engine Suite
LTS-2 utilizes a **dual-mode propulsion architecture**:

### **A. NH3/LOX Chemical Mode (Primary for Launch/Landing)**
- High thrust for surface ascent and descent  
- Regolith-protected nozzle and insulated thrust structure  

### **B. Hydrogen-Enriched Hybrid Mode (Optional)**
- Ammonia cracked in onboard reactorless cracking module  
- Hydrogen-enriched combustion increases Isp  
- Activates automatically based on payload mass  

LTS-2 does *not* contain a nuclear reactor.  
It interfaces with depot-produced LH2/NH3 as needed.
