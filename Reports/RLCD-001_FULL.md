# 1. Mission Overview

The Robotic Lunar Construction Division (RLCD) forms the backbone of lunar surface development, enabling autonomous construction of landing pads, habitats, power arrays, regolith shielding, and surface logistics structures. RLCD operates continuously in lunar day/night cycles and is designed to assemble entire lunar bases **before** human arrival.

### Core Objectives:
- Fully robotic base construction  
- Container unloading and sorting  
- Terrain modification and grading  
- Infrastructure integration  
- Long-duration surface operations  
- Zero-crew-risk construction cycle  

RLCD is the “construction workforce” of the lunar frontier.

# 2. Robotics Fleet Architecture

RLCD consists of five primary robotic classes:

## 2.1 R-EX (Regolith Excavator)
- Heavy-duty excavation  
- Capable of building berms and trenches  
- Modular scoop configurations  

## 2.2 R-GR (Grader & Leveler)
- Precision terrain leveling  
- Landing pad preparation  
- Habitat foundation smoothing  

## 2.3 R-CR (Cargo Retriever)
- Unloads LCMs from LTS vehicles  
- Moves containers to staging zones  
- Robotic forklift-like operation  

## 2.4 R-AS (Assembly Robot)
- Multi-axis arms  
- Habitat section placement  
- Bolting, welding, and sealing operations  

## 2.5 R-MU (Multi-Utility Rover)
- General support  
- Solar array deployment  
- Emergency towing  
- Diagnostics and repair  

Each class uses the same OSY-built chassis for manufacturing efficiency.
