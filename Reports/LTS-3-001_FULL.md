# 1. Mission Overview

LTS-3 is the flagship of the Lunar Tug Shuttle fleet—a heavy‑lift, multi‑role vehicle designed for:

- Delivery of **10–20 ton** Lunar Cargo Modules (LCMs)
- Transport of **up to 6 crew** for short-duration lunar missions
- Emergency evacuation, inspection, and oversight
- Heavy infrastructure delivery (habitat modules, power units, robotics clusters)

LTS-3 is the workhorse for major construction phases and human-assisted operations.

# 2. Vehicle Architecture

## 2.1 Structural Frame
- Reinforced titanium-carbon hybrid truss
- Shock-isolated crew cabin mount
- Heavy-load belly frame for oversized LCMs
- Radiation-shielded avionics bay (lunar regolith + polyethylene composite)

## 2.2 Dimensions (Target)
- Height: **16–20 m**
- Span (landing legs): **10–12 m**
- Dry mass: **12,000–16,000 kg**
- Wet mass: **40,000–55,000 kg**

# 3. Propulsion System

## 3.1 Engine Architecture
LTS-3 uses a robust **dual-mode propulsion suite**:

### A. NH3/LOX Chemical Main Engines
- Dual main engines producing high thrust for ascent/descent
- Regolith-resistant nozzle skirts
- LOX-flow stabilization for dust-heavy landing sites

### B. Hydrogen-Enriched Hybrid Mode
- Onboard ammonia cracking for hydrogen-rich combustion
- Improves ascent Isp for heavy cargo or crew modules

No nuclear reactor onboard; all propellant sourced from cislunar depots.
