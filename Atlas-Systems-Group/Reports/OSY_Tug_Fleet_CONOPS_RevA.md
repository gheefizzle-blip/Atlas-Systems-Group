# OSY TUG FLEET CONOPS – Rev A
**Orbital Shipyard (OSY)**  
**Cislunar & Interplanetary Tug Fleet – Concept of Operations**

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The OSY Tug Fleet is the backbone of all logistics, transport, rescue, construction, and proximity-operations within the OSY ecosystem. This Concept of Operations (CONOPS) establishes unified doctrine, fleet architecture, operational workflows, mission profiles, command structure, maintenance cycles, safety envelope, and integration rules for a three-class, single-platform hybrid tug fleet capable of operating:
- GEO at OSY
- LEO for pod retrieval
- Cislunar space (NRHO, lunar orbit, lunar surface)
- Interplanetary space (Mars Barge missions)
- Mars surface logistics
- Deep space rescue up to 1–2 AU

The fleet implements the Tug-Mediated Docking Doctrine (TMDD) and Full Spectrum Rescue operations across all mission theaters.

## 2. FLEET ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
### 2.1 CLASS A – “Nimble Ops” Tugs
Roles:
- OSY docking/undocking
- Proximity operations
- Inspection & micro-rescue
- Drift stabilization inside OCV

Capabilities:
- Highest maneuver precision
- Fine RCS control
- Autonomous/assisted modes
- Tight-bay navigation

### 2.2 CLASS B – “Heavy Utility” Tugs
Roles:
- LEO→GEO pod retrieval
- Lunar/Mars cargo delivery
- Heavy construction support
- Cislunar SAR operations

Capabilities:
- Modular heavy-lift kits
- High thrust
- Gravity-well capable
- Salvage, tow, repair missions

### 2.3 CLASS C – “Transport & Habitat” Tugs
Roles:
- Crewed lunar landings
- Crew rotation OSY↔NRHO↔Lunar Base
- Deep-space transit to/from Mars Barge
- Interplanetary SAR

Capabilities:
- Full life support
- Radiation shielding
- Medical bay
- Deep-space GNC

## 3. OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE
All tug classes follow:
- Tug-Mediated Docking Doctrine (TMDD)
- Unified platform philosophy
- Deep integration with OSY FCS
- Autonomous Flight Rules (AFR-TUG)

No visiting craft may maneuver independently inside OSY’s POV.

## 4. MISSION PROFILES BY CLASS
### 4.1 CLASS A
- Dock/undock
- Station-keeping enforcement
- Micro-rescue
- Drone handling

### 4.2 CLASS B
- LEO→GEO pod retrieval
- Lunar/Mars cargo landing/ascent
- Construction support
- Medium-range SAR

### 4.3 CLASS C
- Human-rated transport
- Long-duration habitat
- Mars transfer missions
- Full Spectrum Rescue (deep space to 2 AU)

## 5. RESCUE DOCTRINE – FULL SPECTRUM
### 5.1 Cislunar
- Vehicle stabilization
- Crew extraction
- Medical support
- Tow to safe orbit

### 5.2 Lunar Surface
- Emergency ascent kits
- Dust-storm evacuations
- Comms shelter

### 5.3 Mars Transfer
- Deep-space interception
- Habitat support
- Escort damaged craft to barge

### 5.4 Mars Surface
- Emergency landing
- Dust-storm rescue
- Return-to-barge evacuation

### 5.5 Deep-Space (1–2 AU)
- Intercept stranded craft
- Multi-week survival habitat
- Cryogenic med support
- Return preparation

## 6. COMMAND, CONTROL & COMMUNICATIONS (C3)
- FCS for trajectories
- MECSAI for resource allocation
- SDC & COMMS for telemetry/command routing
- ATB-governed safety networks

## 7. MAINTENANCE & LOGISTICS
- Modular design
- Common parts ecosystem
- Quick-swap systems
- Dedicated OSY tug hangars

## 8. TRAINING & CREW DOCTRINE
- Unified training pipeline
- Class C requires advanced medical/nav certification
- Emergency response readiness

## 9. SAFETY AND REDUNDANCY
- AFR-TUG logic
- Propulsion redundancy
- Life-support backups for Class C
- Automated perimeter geofencing

## 10. FUTURE ITERATION PATH
- Nuclear-electric tug variants
- Larger cargo frames
- Autonomous construction integration
- Deep-space SAR Class C Extended variant

## 11. REVISION HISTORY
- Rev A: Initial unified platform CONOPS with Full Spectrum Rescue.
