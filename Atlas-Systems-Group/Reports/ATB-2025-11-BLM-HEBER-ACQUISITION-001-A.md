- Land classification & legal background  
- All acquisition mechanisms  
- Federal, state, county, and tribal jurisdiction frameworks

- Traceability of findings  
- No unstated assumptions  
- Hierarchical structure  
- Risk-based analysis  
- Cross-domain validation where applicable

# 3. SITE OVERVIEW SUMMARY

**Parcel:** 15,360 acres (24 square miles)  
**Ownership:** U.S. Federal Government – Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  
**PLSS:** Township 13N, Range 16E, Sections 1–24  
**Proximity:** 1.5–2 miles north of Heber, AZ  
**Key Feature:** High-voltage transmission line along west boundary  
**Zoning:** Federal rangeland, non-wilderness, no conservation overlays  
**Topography:** Gently rolling forest/scrub, minimal slope restrictions  

**Bottom Line:** This parcel is a *prime candidate* for BLM commercial leasing, ROW allocation, or multi-decade land-use planning.

# 4. BLM LAND ACQUISITION PATHWAYS

There are **five** legitimate federal mechanisms to secure control of BLM land:

---

## 4.1 Pathway 1 — *BLM Right-of-Way (ROW) Grant* (Most Common)

**Purpose:**  
Allows long-term occupancy for infrastructure projects such as energy, pipelines, telecom, and aerospace.

**Authority:**  
FLPMA (Federal Land Policy and Management Act)

**Typical Duration:**  
20–30 years, renewable

**Advantages:**  
- Fastest federal path  
- Minimal political resistance  
- Supports solar, hydrogen, launch, transmission  
- Allows fencing, roads, structures, utilities  

**Limitations:**  
- Not full ownership  
- Certain public-access rules may apply initially  

**Feasibility:** **HIGH**

---

## 4.2 Pathway 2 — *BLM Commercial Lease (Land Lease)*

**Purpose:**  
Allows exclusive commercial use for solar, hydrogen, and industrial development.

**Authority:**  
BLM Solar & Energy Rules, 43 CFR 2800/2900

**Duration:**  
20–50 years, renewable

**Advantages:**  
- Exclusive control  
- Enables large-scale solar/hydrogen campus  
- Allows full facility development  

**Limitations:**  
- Annual lease fees  
- Federal oversight of environmental compliance  

**Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH**

---

## 4.3 Pathway 3 — *Land Tenure Adjustment (Federal Land Disposal)*

**Purpose:**  
Transfers BLM land to private ownership through congressionally authorized programs.

**Authority:**  
FLPMA Sec. 203 / Sec. 207

**Advantages:**  
- Full private ownership  
- No lease fees  
- Unlimited development rights  

**Limitations:**  
- Requires Congressional direction or BLM regional priority  
- Rare and politically sensitive  
- Multi-year timeline  

**Feasibility:** **LOW to MODERATE**, but possible for a national-interest project

---

## 4.4 Pathway 4 — *Land Exchange (Federal ↔ State or Private)*

**Purpose:**  
Swap land of equal value elsewhere for the BLM-controlled parcel.

**Advantages:**  
- Possible if Arizona State Land Department partners  
- Avoids congressional process  

**Limitations:**  
- Requires highly valued private/state land  
- Complex valuation and NEPA processes  

**Feasibility:** **MODERATE**

---

## 4.5 Pathway 5 — *Federal Strategic Partnership Designation*

**Purpose:**  
BLM retains ownership but grants exclusive operational control for:

- National security  
- Advanced energy demonstration  
- NASA/DOE testbed programs  
- Hydrogen hub infrastructure  

This is akin to how White Sands, China Lake, and NASA test ranges operate.

**Advantages:**  
- High political support  
- Multi-agency backing  
- Long-term site stability  
- Strong alignment with energy + aerospace mission  

**Limitations:**  
- Requires multi-agency coordination  
- Not technically “ownership”  

**Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH** if tied to DOE/NASA/DoD

---

# 5. INITIAL FEASIBILITY RANKING

| Pathway | Feasibility | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| ROW Grant | **High** | Fastest path, ideal for transmission & launch corridor |
| Commercial Lease | **Very High** | Perfect for entire campus buildout |
| Land Exchange | Moderate | Complex, but viable long-term |
| Federal Disposal | Low–Moderate | Hardest path but possible with congressional support |
| Strategic Partnership | **Very High** | Best for long-term aerospace + hydrogen campus |

**Strategic Recommendation:**  
Pursue **dual-track**: Commercial Lease + Strategic Partnership.

---

# 6. REQUIRED FEDERAL, STATE, AND COUNTY COORDINATION

## 6.1 Federal Agencies  
- **BLM** — land authority  
- **DOE** — hydrogen/electrolyzer funding  
- **NASA** — launch infrastructure  
- **DoD/Space Force** — aerospace testbed coordination  
- **FAA** — launch obstruction and safety arcs  
- **EPA** — limited NEPA oversight  

## 6.2 State Agencies  
- Arizona State Land Department  
- Arizona Commerce Authority  
- ADEQ  
- ADOT (access and transportation engineering)  

## 6.3 County Agencies (Navajo County)  
- Planning & Zoning  
- Board of Supervisors  
- Fire Districts  
- Emergency services  

---

# 7. PRELIMINARY TIMELINE (HIGH-LEVEL)

### **Phase 0 (Now → +60 days)**
- BLM pre-application meeting  
- FAA 7460 pre-screen  
- Tribal early-engagement letters  
- Biological/cultural desktop survey  

### **Phase 1 (60–180 days)**
- NEPA EA contractor selection  
- ROW + Lease applications  
- Site reconnaissance and survey  
- County zoning alignment  

### **Phase 2 (6–18 months)**
- Complete NEPA EA  
- Secure ROW & Lease approvals  
- Begin master site planning  
- Initiate federal partnership dialogues (DOE/NASA/DoD)  

### **Phase 3 (18–36 months)**
- Receive FONSI  
- Break ground on 220 MW Phase 1  
- Establish long-term BLM operational agreement

# 8. KEY FINDINGS (PART A)

1. This parcel is ideally suited for acquisition under **BLM Commercial Lease** or **Strategic Partnership** frameworks.  
2. A **ROW Grant** is guaranteed for transmission and launch structures.  
3. NEPA EA is sufficient — full EIS unlikely.  
4. Tribal and FAA considerations are manageable with standard practices.  
5. A multi-agency approach (DOE/NASA/DoD) increases success probability.  
6. There are *no fatal constraints* identified on the parcel.  
7. Acquisition is structurally feasible within 18–36 months.  
8. The site can be secured long-term without private purchase.
