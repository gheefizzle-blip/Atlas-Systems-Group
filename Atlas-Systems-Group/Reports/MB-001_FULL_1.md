# 1. Mission Overview

The MB-Class Mars Barge is the backbone of Mars Division logistics.  
It is a **non-crew, deep-space cargo supercarrier** capable of transporting *hundreds* of standardized Mars Cargo Modules (MCMs) per synodic window, enabling industrial-scale resupply and construction.

### Primary objectives:
- Deliver massive cargo loads to Mars orbit every ~26 months  
- Return empties and reusable assets to OSY  
- Operate fully autonomously with minimal maintenance  
- Interface seamlessly with MTS shuttles and orbital depots  
- Provide radiation-safe storage for sensitive payloads  

The barge is the first true interplanetary freight platform.

# 2. Structural Architecture

## 2.1 Frame & Truss Superstructure
- Zero-G optimized “rail yard” layout  
- Titanium–carbon composite truss spine (200–350 m long)  
- Modular frame sections with robotic assembly hooks  
- Meteor-shielded cargo spine  

## 2.2 Dimensions (Target)
- Length: **200–350 meters**  
- Width: **30–50 meters**  
- Cargo racks: **100–300 MCM positions**

# 3. Propulsion & Tug Interface

## 3.1 Propulsion Philosophy
The barge **does not propel itself.**  
It is *pulled* or *pushed* by high-efficiency interplanetary tugs.

Compatible tug types:
- Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP)
- Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)
- Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) (supplemental)
- Future fusion-electric architectures

## 3.2 Tug Interface Module (TIM)
Located on barge forward spine:
- Multi-tug docking clamps  
- Load-distributing thrust couplers  
- Redundant structural straps  
- Smart force-balancing algorithms  

Barge can be towed by **1–4 tugs** depending on:
- Total mass  
- Time constraints  
- Mission profile

# 4. Cargo Architecture

## 4.1 Cargo Module Slots
Supports all Mars Cargo Module classes:
- **MCM-S** (1–2 ton)
- **MCM-M** (5–8 ton)
- **MCM-L** (10–20 ton)

Cargo bays arranged along:
- Central double spine rail  
- Lateral fold-out cargo wings  
- Robotic loading/unloading arms  

## 4.2 Retention & Load Management
- Magnetic-lock rails  
- Redundant mechanical latches  
- Shock-isolating cradle frames  
- RFID-based cargo manifest control  

## 4.3 Container Density
Barge container capacity:
- **Minimum:** 100 MCM-L equivalent  
- **Maximum:** 300 mixed MCM configurations

---

# 7. Radiation & Environmental Protection

## 7.1 Radiation Shielding
- Water-jacketed cargo zones  
- Polyethylene-laminate shielding  
- Regolith-filled panels (optional, MCM delivered)  

## 7.2 Impact Protection
- Triple-layer Whipple shields  
- Debris-tracking micro-radar  
- Auto-orientation to minimize frontal area  

---

# 8. Docking & Operations in Mars Orbit

## 8.1 Arrival
- Barge is braked into Mars orbit by tugs  
- Parks in **HEMO** or **Areostationary Orbit**  

## 8.2 Shuttle Interface (MTS fleet)
- 10+ shuttle docking rails  
- Autonomous loading/unloading  
- Mass-optimized sequencing  

## 8.3 Empty Return Cycle
- Empties loaded back into cargo racks  
- Barge returns to OSY for reloading

# 9. OSY Manufacturing & Assembly

## 9.1 Construction Sequence
1. Fabricate spine sections  
2. Robotic truss connection  
3. Install cargo rails  
4. Add solar and radiator assemblies  
5. Fit TIM interface  
6. Full systems test  
7. Tug transfer to deployment orbit  

## 9.2 Production Rate
- 1 MB-Class barge every **18–24 months**

# 10. Mission Cycle Summary

### Step-by-step:
1. OSY loads barge with 100–300 MCMs  
2. Tugs attach  
3. Interplanetary cruise (3–6 months depending on tug type)  
4. Mars orbital capture  
5. MTS shuttles unload cargo to surface  
6. Empties reloaded  
7. Tugs return barge to OSY  
8. Inspection, refurbishment, reload  

A scalable, cyclic logistics engine.
