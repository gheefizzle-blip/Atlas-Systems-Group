# 1. PURPOSE  
This Part B document provides a full technical assessment of the high-voltage transmission line adjacent to the 15,360-acre Heber North parcel.  

---

# 2. VOLTAGE CLASS DETERMINATION  
Based on tower geometry, conductor spacing, and insulator drop:  
- Likely 115 kV or 230 kV  
- Tower height suggests transmission-grade, not distribution  
- Conductor separation ~10–14 ft matches APS 230 kV profile  

---

# 3. UTILITY OWNERSHIP MAPPING  
Three candidate operators:  
- APS (primary regional carrier)  
- SRP (unlikely this far NE)  
- WAPA (if federal intertie)  

APS most probable given corridor alignment.

---

# 4. RIGHT-OF-WAY CORRIDOR  
ROW is federally permitted. Benefits:  
- Immediate tie-in capability  
- Accelerated interconnection study timelines  
- Existing maintenance roads  

---

# 5. SUBSTATION SITING  
Recommended 3 possible sites along west boundary:  
1. NW corner (minimal grading)  
2. Central west boundary pad  
3. SW access spur  

---

# 6. EXPORT CAPACITY MODEL (220MW → 1.5GW)  
Phase 1: 220 MW — direct tie-in feasible  
Phase 2: 500 MW — requires 230 kV step-up  
Phase 3: 1.0–1.5 GW — new 345 kV backbone recommended  

---

# 7. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS  
- GSU Transformers: 34.5kV→230kV  
- Breaker-and-a-half switchgear  
- Reactive compensation  
- Dual redundant feeders  

---

# 8. REDUNDANCY & RESILIENCE  
- Dual tie-in capable  
- Supports MECSAI blackout recovery  
- Enables black-start capability
