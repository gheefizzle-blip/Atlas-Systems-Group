# 1. Mission Overview

The Cislunar Depot Network is the logistics nexus between the OSY Orbital Shipyard and all lunar surface operations. Depots provide:

- **Refueling** for NH3 and LOX  
- **Cargo staging** for LCM-S/M/L modules  
- **LTS fleet turnaround**  
- **Maintenance and inspection bays**  
- **Orbital navigation and traffic control**  
- **Emergency safe harbor**  

Cislunar depots are the equivalent of orbital “ports,” enabling sustained lunar industrialization.

# 2. Depot Location & Orbit

Depots may exist in multiple orbits depending on mission phase:

## 2.1 LLO Depot (Low Lunar Orbit)
- ~100 km circular  
- Fast access to lunar surface  
- Highest operations tempo  

## 2.2 NRHO Depot (Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit)
- Long dwell time  
- Reduced stationkeeping required  
- Ideal for long-duration missions and staging  

## 2.3 GEO-Intercept Depot (Future)
- For Earth–Moon supply chain  
- Long-term expansion node  

Initial deployment focuses on LLO + NRHO pairing.

# 11. Operations Cycle

1. Tug delivers payload from OSY  
2. Depot unloads cargo and stores LCMs  
3. LTS picks up loaded LCMs  
4. LTS descends to lunar surface  
5. LTS returns with empties  
6. Depot refuels LTS  
7. Repeat continuous cycle  

This forms the logistical heartbeat of the lunar economy.
