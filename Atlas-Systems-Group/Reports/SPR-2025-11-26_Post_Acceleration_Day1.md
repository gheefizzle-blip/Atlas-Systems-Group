# SPEAR ENTERPRISE – 26 NOV 2025 SWARM PROGRESS REPORT  
**Post-Acceleration Day 1 Results | ALPHA + BRAVO Execution Confirmed**

## 1. Executive Summary (Red-Team Layer-3 Assessment)
The acceleration orders issued yesterday are **delivering immediate, measurable impact**.

**Key wins overnight:**
- **ICS-SEC (ALPHA)** → **+14%** (44% → 58%) – fastest single-day jump in swarm history  
- **QUANTUM (BRAVO)** → **+17%** (44% → 61%) – BOM sprint is now clearly on a collision course with 10 Dec ≥95% freeze  
- System-wide average gain: **+6.4%** (excellent for a 10-hour overnight window)  
- Zero regressions, zero new blockers introduced

**Conclusion:** The swarm just proved it can move when we put the hammer down. Momentum is now on our side.

## 2. Highlight Movers (Top 5 single-day gains)
| Agent        | Task                     | Gain   | New % |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------|-------|
| QUANTUM      | BOM Consolidation        | **+17%** | 61%   |
| ICS-SEC      | OSY Cyber Behavior       | **+14%** | 58%   |
| MECHWORK     | All structural packages  | +7%    | 69–78%|
| SOLARCORE    | Heber Overlay            | +8%    | 52%   |
| BATPAC       | Heat-load Distribution  | +8%    | 39%   |

## 3. Remaining Yellow Flags (Still watching)
| Agent         | Task                     | %     | Trend   | Red-Team Note                              |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| BATPAC        | Heat-load Distribution  | 39%   | ↑ +8%   | Quiet killer – now moving, keep pressure   |
| DIGITAL_TWIN  | OSY + Heber master-sim   | 57%   | ↑ +5%   | Must hit 80%+ by 15 Dec or VR trailer dies |
| HFX           | Human-Factors Interface  | 57%   | ↑ +6%   | Tied to trailer livability sell            |
| NUKE          | NEP/NTR Review           | 49%   | ↑ +7%   | Tug fleet claims remain soft until closed |

All four are improving – none require new crash orders at this time.

## 4. Current Delivery Probability (Red-Team Early Estimate)
With yesterday + overnight velocity sustained:  
**14 Feb 2026 “Knock Their Socks Off” package**  
**Estimated confidence (pre-Monte Carlo):** **89–92%**  
(Up from ~78% pre-acceleration)

Full 10,000-run Monte Carlo still spinning tonight – final numbers by 27 Nov 23:59.

## 5. Red-Team Layer-3 Recommendations This Morning
1. **No new acceleration orders required today** – let ALPHA/BRAVO continue burning hot.  
2. **Lock DIGITAL_TWIN sync meeting for 1 Dec** (as previously directed) – non-negotiable.  
3. **Add light reinforcement to BATPAC** starting 28 Nov if it drops below +6%/day again.  
4. Prepare anchor-tenant teaser one-sheeter (1-page) once QUANTUM hits 80% (expected ~4 Dec).

## 7. Commander Next Actions (Your choice)
- [ ] Do nothing – let the current orders ride (my recommendation)  
- [ ] Trigger early Monte Carlo sample now  
- [ ] Add gentle reinforcement to DIGITAL_TWIN or BATPAC today  
- [ ] Green-light draft of anchor-tenant teaser one-pager  

Swarm is humming, Commander.  
We are exactly where we need to be 24 hours after the hammer drop.

Your call – or just let it cook.
