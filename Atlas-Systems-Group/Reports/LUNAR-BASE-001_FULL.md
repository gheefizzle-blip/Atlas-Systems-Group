# 1. Executive Overview
This document outlines the internal concept architecture for the first Spear Enterprise lunar base. It is a planning framework designed to evolve once customer, military, and scientific requirements become available. All sections are fully developed for internal ATB review.

---

# 2. Base Objectives
- Establish a robotic-built, regolith-shielded pressurized habitat cluster.
- Support long-term robotic construction (RLCD).
- Enable short-duration crew missions once base is operational.
- Create a scalable foundation for future commercial and military expansions.
- Integrate seamlessly with LTS-1/2/3 logistics cycle.

---

# 3. Site Selection Criteria
- Low-latitude site near stable illumination.
- Access to shadowed craters for potential water ice.
- Flat terrain for MRCD grading and landing pads.
- Low seismic activity.
- Minimal slope, high structural stability.

---

# 4. Base Layout Overview
## 4.1 Landing Pad Cluster
- Three landing pads arranged in a triangular pattern.
- Regolith berms surrounding each pad to control ejecta.
- MRCD-built compacted regolith foundation.
- Clear separation for dust and plume mitigation.

## 4.2 Habitat Cluster
- MCM‑L pressurized modules forming a hexagonal base.
- Connected by pressurized tunnels.
- Covered under 2–5 meters of regolith.
- Central safe room (radiation + thermal shelter).

## 4.3 Solar Field & Power Grid
- 1–2 acre solar array field.
- MRCD‑built berms to reduce dust deposition.
- Power trunk lines buried 1–2 meters deep.

## 4.4 MRCD Operations Zone
- Dedicated staging yard.
- Maintenance trench.
- Autonomous charging bays.

## 4.5 LCM Storage & Staging
- Surface container yard for MCM‑S/M/L.
- Robotic rail-guided handling lanes.

## 4.6 Communication & Sensor Towers
- High-gain antenna.
- Optical nav beacon for LTS vehicles.
- Radiation and seismic monitoring nodes.

## 4.7 Utility Trunk Network
- Buried power lines.
- Data fiber bundles.
- Thermal loops for heat distribution.

---

# 7. Habitat Geometry & Shielding
- MCM-L modules arranged in hexagon pattern for load distribution.
- 2–5 meters regolith layer for radiation protection.
- Internal pressurized corridors insulated and thermally isolated.

---

# 8. Logistics Cycle (LTS Integration)
- LTS‑1 handles small robotics/tool modules.
- LTS‑2 handles most structural and utility MCM-M cargo.
- LTS‑3 handles large habitat modules.
- Empties returned to depot on each sortie.
- MRCD retrieves all containers autonomously.

---

# 9. Expansion Roadmap (10-Year Horizon)
- Ring‑2 habitat additions.
- Lunar industrial workshop.
- Power field expansion.
- Helium‑3 processing testbed (future).
- Shielded observatory station.
- Pressurized rover garage.

---

# 10. Customer & Military Integration Points
